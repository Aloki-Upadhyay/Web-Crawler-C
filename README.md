# 🕷️ Web Crawler in C

This project is a simple **web crawler** implemented in the **C programming language**.

It performs the following tasks:

- Starts crawling from a given **seed URL**
- Downloads the corresponding **HTML content**
- Parses the page to extract **hyperlinks**
- Recursively visits and processes discovered links
- Avoids revisiting duplicate URLs using basic **data structures**
- Operates with manual memory and network management, using **low-level C programming techniques**

> This project demonstrates how core web crawling functionality can be achieved without relying on high-level libraries, offering a deeper understanding of HTTP, HTML parsing, and memory handling in C.
